# Django Game Project

This is a **small Django-based game** with an **API endpoint to save and retrieve scores**. The project demonstrates web development, containerization, and CI/CD automation.

## Technologies Used

* **Django** – Chosen for its simplicity in handling templates and static files, making web app development fast and efficient.
* **SQLite** – Lightweight database used to store scores; suitable since no sensitive or private data is required.
* **Docker** – Containerized the application to ensure it runs consistently across different environments.
* **GitHub/GitLab Workflows** – CI/CD pipeline implemented to automate building and deploying the Docker image whenever changes are pushed.
